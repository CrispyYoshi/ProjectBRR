This is the BRR repository, where the goal is to organize SNES instruments (custom imported BRRs too!) by the instrument and not the game.

Anyone is allowed to amend to the list, however I only ask that the format is kept consistent to the rest of the repository. Please do not modify any files created by other users. (You can add instruments to the proper folders though.)
